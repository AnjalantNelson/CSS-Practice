# CSS-Practice

In this project you will find my attemtps at using CSS on a random quote generator.

Challenges and Victories: in this project my biggest victory was being able to change the font to the style that i originally planned for and to see it on my webpage made it feel complete. My biggest challenge although is getting my generator to work and put out the quotes that i have in the javascript code.
